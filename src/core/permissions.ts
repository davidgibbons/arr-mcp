 * The two tiers, as an **ordered** pair rather than two

 *
 * `safe` is a mutation the service itself can undo: monitor a movie, trigger a
 * search, pause a download. `destructive` loses something — files on disk, a
 * request's history, a queue item and its blocklist entry.
 *
 * Ordering is the whole point. `destructive: true` grants `safe` as well,
 * because a config that permits deleting a film but refuses to let it be
 * re-monitored describes no coherent policy anyone would choose on purpose —
 * and a user who set the scarier-sounding flag and then found `add_media`
 * refused would reasonably read that as a bug. Someone who genuinely wants
 * neither leaves both off, which is the default (see PermissionsSchema).
