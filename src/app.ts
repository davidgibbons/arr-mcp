const INSTRUCTIONS = `One endpoint for a self-hosted media stack: Radarr and Sonarr manage films and series, Whisparr scenes, Prowlarr the indexers, Bazarr subtitles, Jellyfin playback, Seerr requests, SABnzbd, Transmission and qBittorrent downloads.

Reading:
- \`get_library\` is the join across Radarr, Sonarr, Whisparr and Jellyfin — the only tool that can say a file one service believes in is missing from the other.
- \`diagnose\` answers "why can I not play this" in one call. Prefer it over assembling that answer from several reads.
- Every list is a window: \`items\`, \`total\`, \`returned\`, \`offset\`, \`truncated\`. \`total\` counts the whole list, never the window — it is the number to report when someone asks how many. \`offset + returned < total\` means there is another page; page two of 50 is \`offset: 50\`.
- \`degraded\` names services that did not answer. A short list may be an outage rather than an answer, so say which it was.

Writing:
- Writes happen in two calls. The first previews: read \`summary\` and \`effects\`, then call again passing the returned \`confirm\` token to apply it. \`applied\` says which of the two just happened. \`dry_run: true\` previews without ever issuing a token.
- Writes take a service and an id, never a title. Get the id from \`get_library\` or \`get_media_details\` first.
- A write refused for permissions names the config key that would allow it. Report that key rather than retrying.

Arguments are strict: an argument a tool does not have is refused rather than ignored, and the error lists what it does accept.`;

/**
 * The token's ceiling, folded into the one field that carries authority.
 *
 * Everything else on the context is read-side and ungated — any of the three
 * scopes grants reads, because every write resolves its target by reading
 * first and a write-scoped token that could not read could not preview
